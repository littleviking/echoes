INTRODUCTION
------------
Echoes provides a visual notification on web pages when another visitor is
hovering over the same page area at the same time. Data is anonymized, and users
don't gain any functionality to contact each other. The interaction is kept
minimal - a simple visual cue that the user is not alone at that moment.
